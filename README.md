# Redlining Analysis: Examining Two Major US Banks

## Overview

This project analyzes redlining practices by examining the lending behaviors of two major US banks: City National Bank and Park National Bank. Redlining is the discriminatory practice of denying services, such as loans or insurance, to residents of certain areas based on their race or ethnicity. By comparing the lending patterns of these banks and their peers, this analysis aims to identify potential instances of redlining.

## Project Structure

- **Data Files:**
  - `CityNationalBank_combined.csv`: Combined data file for City National Bank
  - `ParkNationalBank_combined.csv`: Combined data file for Park National Bank
  - `CityNationalBank_2017.csv`: 2017 data file for City National Bank
  - `ParkNationalBank_2017.csv`: 2017 data file for Park National Bank

- **Code Files:**
  - `redlining_analysis.py`: Python script for conducting the redlining analysis
  - `README.md`: Markdown file containing project documentation and instructions

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - Load and merge the data files for each bank.
   - Filter and prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Calculate statistical measures, such as mean loan amounts, for each bank and its peers.
   - Perform statistical tests, such as t-tests, to determine significant differences.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations, such as time series plots, to illustrate lending patterns over time.
   - Compare the lending behaviors of the banks and their peers visually.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
